        <h2> What is CSS? </h2>
        <p> CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a style sheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in a markup language. </p>
        <p> CSS describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media. </p>
        <p> CSS is used to control the layout of multiple web pages all at once. </p>
        <p> CSS is used to style an HTML document. </p>
        <p> CSS is used to define styles for your web pages, including the design, layout and variations in display for different devices and screen sizes. </p>
        <p> CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once. External stylesheets are stored in CSS files. </p>
        <p> CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript. </p>
        <p> CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts. </p>
        <p> This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural content. </p>
        <p> CSS can also allow the same markup page to be presented in different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (when read out by a speech-based browser or screen reader) and on Braille-based, tactile devices. </p>
